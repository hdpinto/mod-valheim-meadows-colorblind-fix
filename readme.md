## Credit and Attribution

Original mod was uploaded to [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com) on March 3, 2021, by [Zera1](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/users/889004) but needs minor changes to work with the latest version of Custom Textures. All assets are, as of writing this, unchanged from their original versions and have simply been renamed to be compatible with Custom Textures.
